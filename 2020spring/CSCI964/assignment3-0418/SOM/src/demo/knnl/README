KNNL

Kohonen Neural Network Library

This library is written in C++, using boost library.
To compile is needed boost version 1.33 or newer.

In special case it is possible to reduce code and force
to use library without boost. 

For details look on http://knnl.sourceforge.net.

To compile demo version run:

make 

or 

make release

for debugging use

make debug

or to prepare release version with logger - trivial debugger 
described in debbugger.hpp file:

make tdrelease

There are also included project files for MS Visual Studio and
Dev C++ as well as CMake project prepared with support from CLion. 
CMake uses path to the boost library set as C://Programs//boost_1_60_0.

If this path is different fix the options, please.

Have a fun :-),
Authors.
