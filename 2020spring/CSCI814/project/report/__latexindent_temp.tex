\section{Project Charter}
\textbf{Project Title:} Meeting-Room Booking System\\
\textbf{Date of Authorization:} March 1\\
\textbf{Project Start Date:} March 18\\
\textbf{Project Finish Date:} May 5\\
\textbf{Key Schedule Milestones:}\\(1)Preparations Completed by April 3\\(2)Demo Version completed by April 28\\(3)Officially released\\

\textbf{Project Manager:}\textbf{Wangzhihui Mei},your email; \textbf{Zijia He},296344774@qq.com\\
\textbf{Project Objectives:}Meeting-Room Booking System is a system that JI urgently needs. Our goal is to develop this system within two months\\
\textbf{Main Project Success Criteria:}The software can perfectly realize the functions of registering, logging in, booking classroom, unsubscribing classroom, and checking classroom status. At the same time, the entire project can be completed on schedule.\\
\textbf{Approach:}
(1)Planning the time in advance to ensure that the deadline can be completed as scheduled\\
(2)Determining the framework and technology used as early as possible.Drawing a Gantt chart to clarify the overall workflow and progress.\\\
(3)Holding a meeting once a week to ensure that the construction period is as usual
(4)Perform a series of tests for each new function\\

\section{Project Plans}
\subsection{Project Scope Statement}
\textbf{Product scope description}\\
The software developed in this project is used to book classrooms for JI students.The main functions of this software are user registration, user login, book classroom, unsubscribe classroom, and view the current classroom status.When the user has no registered member, they can only browse the classroom status and cannot book the classroom.When a classroom is booked, the classroom can only be booked again unless the applicant unsubscribes from the classroom or exceeds the scheduled usage time. Otherwise, the classroom will show the status of reservation.\\\\
\textbf{Product user acceptance criteria}\\
\textbf{Target Dates:}The first version of this system should be completed by April 28 and the final version should be completed by May 5.\\
\textbf{Major function:}This system is divided into client and administrator.On the client side, the client can select the classroom, unsubscribe the classroom, and view the current status of the classroom.The administrator can view the user's reservation records and the current classroom status, and can force the user to unsubscribe.\\\\

\textbf{Staffing management plan:}\\
\textbf{Project Manager:}

Determine what kind of product to develop, what business model and business model to choose, etc. And promote the corresponding product development organization, he also needs to coordinate research and development, marketing, operation, etc. according to the product life cycle, determine and organize the implementation of the corresponding product strategy, and other related product management activities.\\
\textbf{Test engineer:}Test engineers should write test plans, plan detailed test plans, and write test cases. In addition, the test engineer needs to put forward suggestions for further product improvement and evaluate whether the improvement plan is reasonable; summarize and statistically analyze the test results, track the test, and provide feedback.\\
\textbf{Front-end engineer:}The front-end engineer is responsible for the layout design, page design and interaction design of the system ui.\\
\textbf{Backend engineer:}The back-end engineer is responsible for the background construction, database management, API management.

\section{Project execution}
%Each team should provide sufficient details about how the project is executed. Thus, using the milestones you have identified in your project plan, you are required to demonstrate how your team has executed the project. For each milestone, you should update your project progress in terms of schedule and cost. For each milestone, appropriate project progress reports need to be generated and you should use Microsoft Project to track your project progress (appropriate baseline should be used to track the project progress). In addition to the outputs from Microsoft Project, you may also want to include the following in the report: project staff assignment, change requests, project management plan updates, deliverables, and at least 4 meeting minutes in the report.

There are 3 phase in out project: Product Design, Development and Release. Accordingly, There is a milestone in the end of each phase: Design Phase Finished, Development Finished and  Released.

\subsection{Product Design}
The baseline cost is ¥58400, while the actual cost is ¥55400.

\noindent During This phase, out team performed Demand Analysis from Mar. 18 to May. 20 with the cost of ¥4800.
We finished the demand analysis within 48 hours, the baseline
