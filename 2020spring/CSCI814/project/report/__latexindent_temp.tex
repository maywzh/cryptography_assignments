\section{Project execution}
%Each team should provide sufficient details about how the project is executed. Thus, using the milestones you have identified in your project plan, you are required to demonstrate how your team has executed the project. For each milestone, you should update your project progress in terms of schedule and cost. For each milestone, appropriate project progress reports need to be generated and you should use Microsoft Project to track your project progress (appropriate baseline should be used to track the project progress). In addition to the outputs from Microsoft Project, you may also want to include the following in the report: project staff assignment, change requests, project management plan updates, deliverables, and at least 4 meeting minutes in the report.

There are 3 phase in out project: Product Design, Development and Release. Accordingly, There is one according milestone in the end of each phase: Design Phase Finished, Development Finished and  Released.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Product Design}
The baseline total cost is ¥20800, while the actual cost is ¥18200. 

\noindent This phase, our team performed Demand Analysis from Mar. 18 to Mar. 19 with the cost of ¥4800 and we finished this phase 1 day in advance compared with baseline. For the prototype design phase, we completed it two days in advance. The actual cost is ¥4000, only 50\% of the baseline cost. We completed the UI design phase 1 days in advance as well. We spend ¥3000 more than baseline ¥11000.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Development}
In this stage, the total baseline cost is ¥30400, while our team spend ¥32000 in this phase. The over-budget and delay happened mainly happened in back-end development and front-end development. The reason for this is that the difficulty of the development is underestimated. Besides, The demand change needs additional time to reassemble the modules and features of the system. But we accelerate the progress of other tasks, and we reach the milestone of this phase in advance by one day.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Release}
The total baseline cost is ¥5600, while the actual price is ¥4400, including ¥2400 in Integration test and ¥2000 in Code review, which is because we applied an automated test in testing tasks, which reduce the cost and accelerate the work progress. Finally, the milestone of Release "Released" come in advance for one day.

\section{Project closing and Lessons-learnt}

%This part of the report should evaluate your project success against your initial plan. It should also answer questions like “Did the project meet scope, time, and cost goals?”, “What went right and what went wrong on this project?”, “What will you do differently on the next project based on your experience working on this project?”. You can refer to Table 3-16 (p.116 in your textbook) for a sample lessons-learnt report. %
\subsection{Did the project meet scope, time and cost goals}
Generally, Our system is consistent with the initial plan. We did the demand analysis and verified the real need of the user. We list must-to-have components and better-to-have components and build the prototype product. We have implemented the meeting booking system with server-side and client-side. We have deployed it in the WeChat mini-program, web browser and Linux server. The procedure runs typically with expected features implemented. But the performance of the system is limited as we use raspberry as a server, which can optimise by migrating the server side to a high-performance server.

\subsection{What went right and what went wrong on this project}
In general, the project meet the expected requirement. We deployed the system server-side in a Linux server, and release the WeChat mini program client publicly. User can use their WeChat account to register the system and can book a meeting room with a complete view of schedule and detail. The demand is satisfied generally.

We completed the project in advance, while some tasks (server-side and front-end development) exceed the deadline of the baseline. The baseline budget has some surplus as we spend RMB 51600 rather than expected RMB 56800. We have done a great job of controlling costs.

Also, the server-side development encountered some difficulties, such as database corrupt and redis cache system crashing. This is mainly because the development specifications are not strictly followed, with formal unit testing applied to the development, this problem is solved.




\subsection{What will we do differently on the next project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start small, then extend. Creating a mini prototype at first and then extend the solution step by step, until it does what it is supposed to. As no one is able to plan everything out in detail from the beginning.
  \item Change one thing at a time. When developing and something fail, or feature stops working. It's better to find the problem if only one thing of the system is changed.
  \item Add logging and error handling early. The logging system can be very helpful in the debugging and diagnosing procedure. It is a way of verifying how things going on in the system.  
  \item All new lines must be executed at least once. A new feature need immediate test to avoid spending time on debugging. Often, the best way is by automatic tests, but not always. But no matter what, every new line of code has to be executed at least once.
  \item Test the parts before the whole. Testing is a method to save time when developing new features. Often there are problems with integrating different parts. If you can trust that the parts work as expected, it becomes much easier to track down the integration problems.
  \item First understand the existing code. Most coding requires changing existing code in some way. Even if it is a new feature, it needs to fit into the existing program. And before you can fit the new stuff in, you need to understand the current solution. Otherwise you may accidentally break some of the existing functionality. This is means that reading code is a skill that is as necessary as writing code. It is also part of the reason why seemingly small changes can still take a long time – you must understand the context in which you make the change.
  \item Read and run. Understand and then develop. You can read the code, and you can run the code. Running the code can be a great help when figuring out what it does. Be sure to make use of both methods.
  \item Fix the known errors, then see what’s left. Sometimes there are several problems present that you know about. The different bugs can interact with each other and cause strange things to happen. Instead of trying to work out what happens in those cases, fix all the know problems and then see what symptoms remain.
  \item Correlate with timestamps. When troubleshooting, use the timestamp of events as a help. Look for even increments. For example, if the system restarted, and a request was sent out around 3000 milliseconds before, maybe a timer triggered the action that lead to the restart.
  \item Ask. Reading and running the code is often great for figuring out what it does and how it works. But if you have the possibility to ask someone knowledgeable (perhaps the original author), use that option too. Being able to ask specific questions, and follow-up questions to those, can give you information in minutes that would otherwise take days to get.
