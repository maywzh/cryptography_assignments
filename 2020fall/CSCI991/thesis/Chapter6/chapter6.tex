In this paper, a test question recommendation system based on graph neural network combined with knowledge mapping and factorization algorithm is established, which generally accomplishes the design goals and is original in the three stages of the recommendation system-data source generation, knowledge tracking and knowledge recommendation, etc. This paper adopts the current more popular graph neural network model and makes some improvements to the existing model to solve the tasks of knowledge analysis of test questions and knowledge state tracking of students, and achieves the desired results in the experiments with some performance improvements to the existing model.

Among them, in the data source part, they are input to the initial database by crawlers and manual input, and then the automatic knowledge point analysis model of test questions based on text mining and graph neural network iterative learning is used to complete the knowledge point label mining of test questions, and they then establish the knowledge map of high school mathematics by some means of knowledge map construction, which solves the "zero resource " problem. In terms of the knowledge tracking of students, this paper innovatively applies the graph self-attentive network to this task, and through the improvement of the model and the consideration of several factors, the task has been improved somewhat compared with the existing model and has improved in performance. Finally, by labeling the knowledge of the test questions and tracking the students' knowledge, the factorization machine algorithm is used to complete the learning resource recommendation, which solves the cold start problem and accomplishes the design goal of adaptive learning.

In future work, the sequential nature of the model can be solved by combining other graph neural network models or adding some memory mechanisms.
