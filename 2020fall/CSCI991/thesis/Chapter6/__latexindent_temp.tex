\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, a test question recommendation system based on graph neural network combined with knowledge mapping and factorization algorithm is established, which generally accomplishes the design goals and is original in the three stages of the recommendation system-data source generation, knowledge tracking and knowledge recommendation, etc. This paper adopts the current more popular graph neural network model and makes some improvements to the existing model to solve the tasks of knowledge analysis of test questions and knowledge state tracking of students, and achieves the desired results in the experiments with some performance improvements to the existing model.

In the data source part, the data are input to the initial database by crawlers and manual input, and then the automatic knowledge point analysis model based on text mining and graph neural network iterative learning is used to complete the knowledge point label mining of the test questions, and then they build the knowledge map of high school mathematics by some knowledge map construction means to solve the problem of "zero resource".
