Some notes:
This is a guide, you are required to output the size and
distributions but the format doesn't need to be precisely
like this.
It's helpful to output where your program is at.
You don't have to list the symbols that don't occur
at all in the sample. This would reduce the size of
the Latin output in a lot of cases.
You don't have to organise the output of those as
above either, it's fine to list one symbol and it's
frequency per line.

You don't have to output the intermediate Latin, but
it's helpful for us if you do!

Depending on how you do translation to Morse you may
end up with an additional space separator at the end,
that's okay.
