Try and organise what you need to do into the three files that you need.

You will have your main function in a driver .cpp file.
You will have your function prototypes in a header/.h file, and the function
implementations in another .cpp file.
So in terms of the relationship between the files it's like the one in the
Debug-B.zip exercise.

You can add comments as to what the functions you need are, and what gets
called from main in what order.
You need to think about the data you are going to store and where that's
going to go.
Once you have done that organisation you can then start looking at
implementing the functions.
