There have been a fair few questions about the functions
for problem diagnosis and fixes.

Here go some illustrations of the type of effect I'm expecting,
for diagnosis here.

Mechanic   Problem determination complexity   Chance of successful diagnosis.
    50               50                                50     --> This is a baseline.
    75               50                                60     --> It's gone up.
    50               25                                60     --> It's gone up.
    50               75                                40     --> It's gone down.
    25               50                                40     --> It's gone down.
    75               75                                50     --> Balanced again.
    25               25                                50     --> Balanced again.


These numbers are indicative of the trend required,
you do not need to have these specific numbers.
You can have percentages greater than 100, for
example a problem with very low determination complexity
might always be identified by a very good mechanic.

You don't have to take a 50, 50, 50 as your baselineor
have the two parameters equally weighted.
