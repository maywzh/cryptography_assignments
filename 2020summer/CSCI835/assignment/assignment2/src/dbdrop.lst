Error starting at line : 8 in command -
DROP PROCEDURE INSERT_ORDER_DETAIL
Error report -
ORA-04043: object INSERT_ORDER_DETAIL does not exist
04043. 00000 -  "object %s does not exist"
*Cause:    An object name was specified that was not recognized by the system.
           There are several possible causes:
           - An invalid name for a table, view, sequence, procedure, function,
           package, or package body was entered. Since the system could not
           recognize the invalid name, it responded with the message that the
           named object does not exist.
           - An attempt was made to rename an index or a cluster, or some
           other object that cannot be renamed.
*Action:   Check the spelling of the named object and rerun the code. (Valid
           names of tables, views, functions, etc. can be listed by querying
           the data dictionary.)
