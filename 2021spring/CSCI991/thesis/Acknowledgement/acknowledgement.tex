    After two years of study at the postgraduate level, when the thesis is completed, I sincerely express my sincere thanks to the teachers, college leaders, counsellors, classmates and friends who have helped me.

    First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Wang, who gave me patient and meticulous guidance and great help in completing my usual scientific research tasks. In the process of topic selection, conception, experimental simulation and thesis writing, many useful and enlightening suggestions were also put forward. Finally, my thesis has been continuously improved. This is all thanks to the stern guidance and teaching of Teacher Wang.

    Then, I would like to thank all the leaders and teachers of the college. They put forward many valuable suggestions during my master's work and study process, which tempered my heart. I am full of gratitude for this. This is undoubtedly a rare and valuable asset for my future career.

    I also want to thank all my classmates and friends who have gone through the research and study career in the past three years. We have helped each other, inspired and cared for each other in our studies. Thank them for their friendship and support.
