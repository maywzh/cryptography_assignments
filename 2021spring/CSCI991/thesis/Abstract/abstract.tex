    In recent years, the artificial intelligence industry has developed rapidly, and artificial intelligence technology has been applied to all walks of life, and the education industry is no exception. Artificial intelligence has also begun to be applied in the education industry, and the concept of intelligent education has emerged. Among the application types of AI technology in education, AI adaptive learning is the most widely used in all aspects of learning. In addition, due to China's large population, shortage of educational resources, emphasis on education and other favorable factors, intelligent adaptive learning systems are expected to appear in the future. In recent years, family adaptive learning has begun to enter the minds of many people involved in education training and education investment. There are more and more educational technology companies in the market focusing on adaptive learning tools. At the same time, many education companies have begun to use adaptive learning as the main core function or main selling point of their products. The biggest advantage of adaptive education is that it can find the knowledge gap of each student. The adaptive learning platform will guide the student to learn the next most appropriate learning content and activity that suits him. When students encounter a course that is too difficult or too low in the learning process, they can automatically adjust the difficulty of the course. Teachers can also analyze the knowledge gap of each student according to the learning status evaluation report provided by the system, adjust the learning progress in real time, and provide personalized teaching for each student. Therefore, in theory, adaptive learning is one of the potential feasible solutions to the problem of "teaching students according to their abilities" in online education. Learning resource recommendation system is the most common form of adaptive learning system. And this article realizes the goal of adaptive learning by designing an exercise recommendation system based on knowledge tracking.

    The adaptive learning system of this paper includes three modules, namely exercise knowledge point mining module, knowledge tracking module and exercise recommendation module. The exercise knowledge point mining module can mark the knowledge points of the exercises without the knowledge points, and use the exercises with the marked knowledge points as the input data for knowledge tracking. The knowledge tracking module tracks the students' question records, thereby tracking the students' knowledge status. The exercise recommendation module combines students' knowledge status and exercise label information to make targeted exercise recommendation.

    In the knowledge point annotation module, a graph convolutional neural network is used to train the label annotation classifier. Use Bi-LSTM to mine the exercise text information, embed the exercise text as the input of the label classifier group, and output a set of label classification results.

    In the knowledge tracking module, a graph attention network is used to learn the knowledge relationship of exercises. The embedding vector is output through the Transformer-based Encoder model to output a knowledge state vector, and then the exercise embedding vector and the knowledge state vector are used as the Transformer-based Decoder The input and output of the model predict the answer to the next exercise.

    In the exercise recommendation module, a recall model based on collaborative filtering and a ranking model based on MLP are used. In the recall phase, collaborative filtering is used to find the problem sets of other students with similar knowledge status. In the sorting phase, the knowledge status vector obtained from the knowledge tracking module and the label vector of the exercises are input into the final ranking model, and a priority sequence of exercise recommendation is input.

    This paper implements the above three modules by designing different neural network models and algorithms. It is innovative in algorithm design and experimental verification methods. After experimental verification, it has better performance than similar models.
