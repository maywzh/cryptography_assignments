\begin{abstract}{Learning Resource Recommendation System, Knowledge Graph}{Knowledge Tracing}{Factorization Machine}
    This paper implements a high school mathematics learning resource recommendation system based on knowledge tracking and factorization machine, which contains three core points. The first one is the design of data source, and proposes an automatic extraction method for test knowledge points. The whole process of high school mathematics knowledge mapping from corpus collection, construction, storage, and update is introduced as well as the automation process. The second point is the implementation of a GCN-based knowledge tracking algorithm, which takes into account the a priori structure of knowledge points as well as students' recent question records and knowledge mastery changes, and achieves a more excellent performance compared to other knowledge tracking models. The third point is based on a deep factorization machine, which solves the problem of sparsity of training data, and it takes the output of the knowledge tracking model as input and considers various other feature inputs to achieve learning resource recommendation.
