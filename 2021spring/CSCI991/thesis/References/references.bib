  abstract  = {Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student’s knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the ﬁeld of computer-aided education. Armed with attention mechanisms focusing on relevant information for target prediction, recurrent neural networks and Transformer-based knowledge tracing models have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative ﬁltering. However, the attention mechanisms of current state-of-the-art knowledge tracing models share two limitations. Firstly, the models fail to leverage deep self-attentive computations for knowledge tracing. As a result, they fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, appropriate features for constructing queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing have not been extensively explored. The usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs), as queries and keys/values, respectively, lacks empirical support.},

  abstract   = {With the rapid development in online education, knowledge tracing (KT) has become a fundamental problem which traces students’ knowledge status and predicts their performance on new questions. Questions are often numerous in online education systems, and are always associated with much fewer skills. However, the previous literature fails to involve question information together with high-order question-skill correlations, which is mostly limited by data sparsity and multi-skill problems. From the model perspective, previous models can hardly capture the long-term dependency of student exercise history, and cannot model the interactions between student-questions, and student-skills in a consistent way. In this paper, we propose a Graph-based Interaction model for Knowledge Tracing (GIKT) to tackle the above probems. More speciﬁcally, GIKT utilizes graph convolutional network (GCN) to substantially incorporate question-skill correlations via embedding propagation. Besides, considering that relevant questions are usually scattered throughout the exercise history, and that question and skill are just diﬀerent instantiations of knowledge, GIKT generalizes the degree of students’ master of the question to the interactions between the student’s current state, the student’s history related exercises, the target question, and related skills. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GIKT achieves the new state-of-the-art performance, with at least 1\% absolute AUC improvement.},
