  abstract   = {E-learners face a large amount of fragmented learning content during e-learning. How to extract and organize this learning content is the key to achieving the established learning target, especially for non-experts. Reasonably arranging the order of the learning objects to generate a well-defined learning path can help the e-learner complete the learning target efficiently and systematically. Currently, knowledge-graph-based learning path recommendation algorithms are attracting the attention of researchers in this field. However, these methods only connect learning objects using single relationships, which cannot generate diverse learning paths to satisfy different learning needs in practice. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a learning path recommendation model based on a multidimensional knowledge graph framework. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, we have designed a multidimensional knowledge graph framework that separately stores learning objects organized in several classes. Then, we have proposed six main semantic relationships between learning objects in the knowledge graph. Secondly, a learning path recommendation model is designed for satisfying different learning needs based on the multidimensional knowledge graph framework, which can generate and recommend customized learning paths according to the e-learner's target learning object. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model can generate and recommend qualified personalized learning paths to improve the learning experiences of e-learners.},

  abstract = {Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) have been used as psychometric tools in educational assessments to estimate studentsâ€™ proficiency profiles. However, most CDMs assume that all students adopt the same strategy when approaching problems in an assessment, which may not be the case in practice. This study develops a generalized multiple-strategy CDM for dichotomous response data. The proposed model provides a unified framework to accommodate various condensation rules (e.g., conjunctive, disjunctive, and additive) and different strategy selection approaches (i.e., probability-matching, over-matching, and maximizing). Model parameters are estimated using the marginal maximum likelihood estimation via expectation-maximization algorithm. Simulation studies showed that the parameters of the proposed model can be adequately recovered and that the proposed model was relatively robust to some types of model misspecifications. A set of real data was analysed as well to illustrate the use of the proposed model in practice.},

  abstract  = {Recommending suitable exercises to students in an online education system is highly useful. Existing approaches usually rely on machine learning techniques to mine large amounts of student interaction log data accumulated in the systems to select the most suitable exercises for each student. Generally, they mainly aim to optimize a single objective, i.e., recommending non-mastered exercises to address the immediate weakness of students. While this is a reasonable objective, there exist more beneficial multiple objectives in the long-term learning process that need to be addressed including Review &amp; Explore, Smoothness of difficulty level and Engagement. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement learning framework, namely DRE, for adaptively recommending Exercises to students with optimization of above three objectives. In the framework, we propose two different Exercise Q-Networks for the agent, i.e., EQNM and EQNR, to generate recommendations following Markov property and Recurrent manner, respectively. We also propose novel reward functions to formally quantify those three objectives so that DRE could update and optimize its recommendation strategy by interactively receiving students' performance feedbacks (e.g., score). We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed DRE can effectively learn from the student interaction data to optimize multiple objectives in a single unified framework and adaptively recommend suitable exercises to students.},
