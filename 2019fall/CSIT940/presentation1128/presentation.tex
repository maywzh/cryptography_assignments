\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Video Game Playing AI}
Video games have long been popular benchmarks for Artificial Intelligence(AI)\cite{1}. Many researches have been done in building a optimal \textbf{Video Game Playing AI(VPAI)}  in certain games. 

Such attempts comprises Chess, Go, Car Racing games, Ms.PacMan, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and Super Mario Bros, etc. 
\end{frame}

\subsection{Research Scope}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Research Scope}
  In this research, we focus on \textbf{General Video Game Playing AI(GVPAI)}.

  GVPAI aims at building an no-human-intervening game-playing agent that is able to playing multiple games rather than specialized VPAI designed for certain one game\cite{1}.

\end{frame}

\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivation\cite{2}}
  The objective of General Video Game Playing (GVGP) is to by-pass the addition of game specific knowledge, especially if the algorithm is tested in games that have not been played before.

  Obviously, algorithms that approach GVGP problems may still count on some kind of domain knowledge, and the questions raised above could still be asked. Indeed, many different algorithms can be employed for GVGP, and chances are that heuristics will still make a big difference. 
  
  However, by reducing the game-dependent knowledge, approaches are forced to be more general, and research conducted in this field is closer to the open domain of General Artificial Intelligence.

\frametitle{Landscapes of GVPAI}
\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge Representation
\item Search
\item Planning
\item Learning
\item Generality
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%[General general game AI]
\subsection{Knowledge Representation}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Knowledge Representation and Reasoning\cite{3}}
GVPAI requires a formal, symbolic language in which the rules of arbitrary games can be described to a system. The general Game Description Language (GDL) has been developed for that purpose. There are several challenging reasoning problems.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reasoning about actions
  \item Automated theorem proving
  \item Other KRR techniques
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Search}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Search\cite{12}}
  Once a GVPAI system is capable of computing legal moves and position updates from the game rules, it can search through the space of possible ways in which the game can proceed
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Monte Carlo Tree Search
    \item Informed search -- Uses problem-specific knowledge.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Planning}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Planning}
  Planning is closely related to GVGP, as both are instances of general problem solving, where the specifics of a problem are unknown until runtime.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Learning}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Learning}
  The very idea of general game playing is to build systems that automatically learn to master arbitrary new games.
  

\end{frame}

\item Game generality
\item Task generality
\item Player generality

\column{.5\textwidth} % Right column and width
Develop AI methods that work with not just one game, but with multiple game.

Develop methods that can do not only one task but several different related tasks.

Develop methods that can model, respond or reproduce the large variability among humans in design style, playing style, preferences and abilities.
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\section{Approaches}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Approachs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Neural Network(NN)
    \item Reinforcement Learning(RL)
    \item Monte-Carlo Tree Search(MCTS)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Neural Network}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{NN-based GVGP}
M. Hausknecht et al. \cite{5} employed evolutionary neural networks to extract higher-dimensional representation forms from the raw game screen.

All algorithms encode Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which are represented by weights and connectivity(topology).
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/m1p1}
  \caption{ANN topology for 3 different state representation}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{RL-based GVGP}
Yavar Naddaf \cite{6} used 2 main approaches: RL-based and search-based methods. RL-based methods use feature vectors generated from the game screen as well as the console RAM to learn to play a given game. The search-based methods use the emulator to simulate the consequence of actions into the future, aiming to play as well as possible by only exploring a very small fraction of the state-space.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/featurevector}
  \caption{ Conceptual figure of feature vector generation for the game Freeway}
\end{figure}

Bellemare et al. \cite{7} explored the concept of contingency awareness (the recognition that a future observation is under an agent's control and not solely determined by the environment) using Atari 2600 games.

The research introduced a technique for accurately identifying contingent regions and describe how to exploit this knowledge to generate improved features for value function approximation.
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/contingentregions}
  \caption{ The contingent regions, shown by a transparent overlay, for Freeway (left) and Beam Rider (right)}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{MCTS-based GVGP}
Perez et. al. \cite{8} explored the performance of a vanilla Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, and analyzed the main difficulties encountered when tackling this kind of scenarios and did some modifications to overcome these issues, strengthening the algorithm's ability to gather and discover knowledge, and taking advantage of past experiences.

\begin{figure}[c]
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/mctskb}
  \caption{ MCTS algorithm steps }
\end{figure}

Park and Kim\cite{9} propose to use influence map (IM) to solve
the MCTSâ€™s horizon effect problem.

\begin{figure}[c]
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/kim}
  \caption{ Overview of proposed method (blue is good influence and red is bad influence) }
\end{figure}

Sironi et.al.\cite{10} designed three Self-Adaptive MCTS (SA-MCTS) agents that optimize the parameters of a standard non-Self-Adaptive MCTS agent of GVPAI. 

The three agents select the parameter values using Naive Monte-Carlo, an Evolutionary Algorithm and an N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm respectively, and are tested on 20 single-player games.

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/figure1}
  \caption{ Average win rate over 5 levels of each game}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}

  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  General game playing is an exciting, still young but on the verge of maturing topic, which touches upon a broad range of aspects of artificial intelligence. it provides a rich source of interesting and challenging problems for many an AI researcher.
