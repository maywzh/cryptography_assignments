% \section*{Situation}
% When students study alone, they encountered many problems, such as distraction, puzzles and lack of sense of achievement. Tradiationally, They use Pomodoro Techniques, GTD software and other tools to help them study and work efficiently. However, a software integrating all these functionalities is required. 

\section*{Design:}
Our goal is to build a software system integrating GTD, Q\&A, record and virtual study room modules, which aims to assist students in their study. 

\noindent We generally divide our system into four modules --- Personal, Study, Social and Q\&A. Each module contains functional services, which are based on some basic service. We list some must-have services and good-to-have services.

\subsection*{Must-have services}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User profile service: User can edit profiles. They can fetch various personal data.
    \item Report service: User or Administer can fetch data report through this serviuce. Feed flows are also generated in this service.
    \item Attendance service: User can record their attendance in stydy room service. 
    \item Push service: Subscriber can subscribe to certain events, Pusher push notification to subscriber.
    \item Follow service: Follower automatically subscribe to followed topics or users.
    \item Message Service: User can send message privately to each other, this is based on push service.
    \item Calendar service: User can create their learning canlendar. 
    \item Task service: User can add/delete/modify learning task. It notify users through push services. Task report can be generated through report service.
    \item Network disk service: User manage learning materials with online disk based on permission.
    \item Self-study room service: User create online study room. It can interact with Calendar services and Task service.
    \item Search Service: User can search for other user, study room, material, question, answer based on input data type and keyword.
    \item Question Service: User can add/modify/remove questions with several topics/tags. Questions can also be follower through follow service.
    \item Answer Service: Users can add/modify/remove their answers and comment/vote other users' answers.
    % \item Exercise Service: Exercise creator create/update/delete/submit/withdraw exercise doing. Self-study room creator agree/return exercise doing. Book participants join exercise doing/learning timing/summarize learning results/grade the exercise/view learning progress/exercise summary/evaluation. System automatically rank exercise.
    
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Good-to-have services}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Log service: system automatically generate logs.
    \item Friend service: User can build/remove friend relation with other user.
    \item Dynamic service: User can watch friends' dynamics.
    \item Data service: Service provider can analyse big data to generate data analisis report.
    \item Course service: Course creator create/update/delete/submit/withdraw courses taking. Course participants join courses/learning timing/summarize learning results/grade the course/view learning progress/course summary/evaluation. System automatically rank courses.
    \item Book service: Book participants join book reading/learning timing/summarize learning results/grade the book/view learning progress/book summary/evaluation. System automatically rank books.
    
\end{itemize}
